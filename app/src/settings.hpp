// Player-editable app settings for the port's own UI.
//
// The launcher's SETTINGS tab and the in-game Esc overlay show the same Panel
// (ui.hpp), so the live values and their file live here, as input_map.{hpp,cpp}
// does for the controller bindings: the panel reads them to draw a row and
// writes them through these functions, which apply the change and persist it.
//
// Four settings:
//
// * GAME SPEED, the runtime's emulated-clock multiplier
//   (`ultramodern::set_speed_multiplier`). n means the emulated CPU counter and
//   the VI retrace schedule run n times faster than wall clock, so timed
//   sequences complete in 1/n of the wall time. `OGRE_SPEED=<n>` sets the
//   starting value as a debug override; the SETTINGS tab then changes and saves
//   it.
// * WIDESCREEN, a toggle that puts RT64 into its Expand aspect ratio (a wider
//   field of view) for the mission. See `WidescreenMode` below and
//   `widescreen.cpp`.
// * SOUNDS and VOLUME, the audio output's mute and gain. The app's audio
//   callback scales every buffer it queues by `audio_gain_percent()`. See
//   `SoundMode` and the block below it.
//
// Eight settings in four groups, in the order the SETTINGS tab draws them:
//
// * GAME SPEED.
// * DISPLAY: WIDESCREEN, then RESOLUTION, MSAA and WINDOW, which are the rest of
//   `ultramodern::renderer::GraphicsConfig`. The renderer applies all three on a
//   change (`RT64Renderer::update_config`, app/src/renderer.cpp), so a row
//   changed under the Esc overlay takes effect on the next frame. `widescreen.cpp`
//   owns `ar_option` and this file owns `res_option`, `msaa_option` and
//   `wm_option`; each writer starts from the live config, so neither loses the
//   other's value. CRT FILTER sits between RESOLUTION and MSAA; it is not part
//   of `GraphicsConfig`, and the renderer polls it every frame
//   (`crt_filter_applied`).
// * AUDIO: SOUNDS and VOLUME.
// * INPUT: MOUSE ENABLED, off by default, which is what lets the pointer drive
//   the world map's and the mission field's cursors. See `MouseMode` below.
//
// The file is `<config>/settings.cfg`, plain text.
