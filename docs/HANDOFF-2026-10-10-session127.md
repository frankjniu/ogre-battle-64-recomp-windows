# Handoff — 2026-10-10, session 127: the world map's cursor follows the mouse

Developer request: *"I just merged a PR in my project (commit cf5b9285). It claims
to add some basic mouse support, but I tested the game and could not reproduce
it. can you help me check if it really adds the mouse support feature?"* and then,
after the review: *"we should refactor/discard the contribution, and use only the
added knowledge. that 'world map' screen has a cursor. if we could make the cursor
position match the mouse, that would be very cool!"*

**Result: the merged PR contains no working mouse support, and the world map's
cursor is now driven by the mouse.** The cursor sprite follows the pointer and is
clamped by the game's own play area; a left click acts as the game's `A` and
selects the location under the cursor; a pointer pushed past the map's edge
scrolls the view; the operating system pointer is hidden while it is over the
game window. All four are developer-confirmed. The PR's own cursor design is
deleted; its two `_WIN32`-only fixes and its `tools/elfcheck.py` sign-extension
fix are left in the tree as they were.

## 1. The merged PR's cursor support is dead code

`cf5b9285` is a merge of `338c15a` ("Keep the window responsive, and aim the
world-map cursor with a click"), touching five files. Four parts are real:

| Part | File | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| An owned `IFileDialog` for the start screen's picker | `app/src/launcher.cpp` | `_WIN32` only |
| Quick Edit disable on the boot console | `app/src/main.cpp` | `_WIN32` only |
| `nm` sign-extension mask in the symbol check | `tools/elfcheck.py` | unrelated to input |
| `ole32`/`uuid` link for the COM dialog | `app/CMakeLists.txt` | `_WIN32` only |

The fifth part, `ogre_cursor_click_apply` (`app/src/sdl_platform.cpp`), is the
cursor feature, and **nothing ever calls it**:

- `git grep cursor_click` returns only the definition and its own helper
  functions. A caller in another translation unit, or an address-of, does not
  exist.
- The intended caller is generated bank code, which has no hook table. It is a
  flat library of `RECOMP_FUNC` bodies (`BankMFuncs/funcs.h`) and mentions the
  hook nowhere.
- The function has no compile error: compiling `app/src/sdl_platform.cpp`
  standalone with the project's own command from
  `build-app/compile_commands.json` produces `T _ogre_cursor_click_apply`. The
  symbol exists in the binary as dead code.

What the PR did do is print one `[cursor] click -> x,y` line on stderr per click.
That is the whole observable effect, and it is why the feature could not be
reproduced. Note also that `build-app/ogrebattle64` was dated 2026-10-03 while the
merge is 2026-10-09, so a test of the pre-existing binary contained none of it
either.

## 2. What the cursor actually is, at instruction level

The map module is bank unit M (scene `0x05`, descriptor `0x8018FD70`, enter
`func_8017B60C`, update `func_8017B858`, hook `func_8017B9C8`). The cursor is a
**screen-space sprite**, and its position is a pair of halves in the map's state
object, `state = *(u32*)0x80197B18`:

```
state[+0x50] (u8)   1 = draw the cursor   (set by the state machine at
                                          0x8019B094, 0x8019BD64, 0x8019D738;
                                          cleared at 0x8019B32C)
state[+0x52] (s16)  cursor x
state[+0x54] (s16)  cursor y
```

The **scene hook's cursor draw** reads that pair and emits sprite `a2=6`
(`func_ovlM_801A103C`, generated in `BankMFuncs/funcs_0.c`):

```
801a1c34: lw   v1,0x7B18(v1)     ; v1 = *(u32*)0x80197B18 = the map state
801a1c3c: lbu  v0,0x50(v1)       ; 1 = draw
801a1c40: beq  v0,zero,0x801a1c5c
801a1c48: lh   a0,0x52(v1)       ; x
801a1c4c: lh   a1,0x54(v1)       ; y
801a1c50: jal  0x8019F83C        ; emit sprite, a2 = 6 = the cursor
```

The **state machine that keeps the pair current** is `func_ovlM_8019AF0C`: a
jump table on `state[+0x1C4]` (bound `0x6F` at `0x8019AF48`, table at
`0x801A7F80`), with the cursor moved by clamped adds and subtracts at
`0x8019B388`, `0x8019B3A8`, `0x8019B3E8`, `0x8019B410`, `0x8019B4F0`,
`0x8019B7B4`, `0x8019B834`, `0x8019B894`, `0x8019C8E8` and `0x8019D514`, and
clamped to x `0x28..0x110`, y `0x28..0xC0` at `0x8019B8E0`-`0x8019B924`. The
clamps are the play area the pointer may place the cursor in.

The cursor is **not** a node grid. The developer asked for snap-on-rest first;
635 logged cursor positions (run 1) span x 49..240 and y 40..176 with 1-2 pixel
deltas and no repeated node set, so there is no node table to snap to, and the
developer cancelled that milestone: *"on second thoughts, we don't need the 'snap
on rest' feature. is works very well now!"*

Two facts about the state that a later session should not have to rediscover:
`state[+0x1CA]` is an index and `state[+0x110] + 6*index` is a 6-byte record
array the state machine writes the current index value into (a dozen sites, e.g.
`0x8019B110`-`0x8019B128`); and the `sw ..., 0x50($t2)` / `0x54($t3)` stores
inside the draw are the **display-list cursor** `D_800E9BA0`, not the state.

## 3. The change

- **`app/src/map_cursor.cpp`** (new) — the hook and the mouse state.
  `ogre_map_cursor(rdram, state)` writes the pointer's framebuffer pixel into
  `state+0x52`/`+0x54`. `ogre_map_cursor_note_mouse` aspect-fits the 320x240
  framebuffer inside the drawable and keeps the pixel, clamped, plus the edge
  direction. `ogre_map_cursor_click` arms the confirm.
  `ogre_map_cursor_take_confirm` and `ogre_map_cursor_edge_direction` are read
  by `get_input`.
- **`app/src/map_cursor.hpp`** (new) — the state layout, the call site, and what
  each entry point is for.
- **`tools/map_cursor.py`** (new) — inserts the call into `BankMFuncs/funcs_0.c`
  immediately before the `0x801A1C48` x load, and the declaration after
  `#include "funcs.h"`. Idempotent, `--revert` removes it, and an anchor that
  stops matching is an error rather than a silent no-op.
- **`Makefile`** — `bank-recomp` runs `tools/map_cursor.py` after
  `tools/hd_backgrounds.py`, because `Bank*Funcs/` is regenerated and bank code
  is outside the mod hook map (the `tools/hd_backgrounds.py` pattern).
- **`app/CMakeLists.txt`** — `src/map_cursor.cpp` in both the native and web
  source lists.
- **`app/src/sdl_platform.cpp`** — samples `SDL_MOUSEMOTION` and reports the
  click to `ogre_map_cursor_note_mouse`/`_click`; ORs the confirm's `A` and the
  edge D-pad bits into controller 0 in `get_input`; owns the operating system
  pointer's visibility. The PR's `note_cursor_click`, `ogre_cursor_click_apply`
  and their latched-click globals are deleted.
- **Docs** — `docs/guides/app-build.md` §"The world map's mouse cursor",
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` (2026-10-10), `PLAN.md` Key technical findings.

### How the three behaviours reach the game

**Cursor position.** The write happens on the game thread, at the draw site,
after the state machine has updated `+0x52`/`+0x54` for the frame and before the
draw reads them, so it wins for the frame in progress. The game's own clamp
still applies (`game=(40,40)` when the pointer is at the framebuffer corner).

**Click.** The click does not move the cursor. `ogre_map_cursor_click` arms a
counter, and `ogre_map_cursor_take_confirm` decrements it once per pad poll, so
`get_input` ORs `0x8000` (N64 `A`) into controller 0's buttons for 8 polls
(`OGRE_MAP_CURSOR_CONFIRM_POLLS`). This is the same path the keyboard and the
live console's `press` command use. The poll is `func_8007297C`
(`asm/1060.s:2163`), the report is `D_800E79B0`, and the OSContPad is
`D_800C4BF0` (`func_8007284C` reads `lhu 0(D_800C4BF0)`).

**Edge scroll.** The cursor's clamp means a pointer beyond a bound cannot place
the sprite there, so the intent is sent as **D-pad** input instead: a pointer
within 24 pixels of a bound (`OGRE_MAP_CURSOR_EDGE`) holds the matching bit
(`0x0100` right, `0x0200` left, `0x0400` down, `0x0800` up). The direction is
computed from the pointer's pixel clamped into the framebuffer, so a pointer in
the pillarbox or in the black border of a fullscreen window still scrolls.

**Scoping.** The map's cursor draw is the only report that the map is the active
scene, so it sets a frame counter and `map_is_active()` gates both the confirm
and the edge direction to it. The `A` a click injects is therefore inert on the
title, the menus and the mission screen. The hook first runs immediately after
the map module is DMA'd in (`[bank] loading overlay record rom=0x079750
ram=0x8019A7C0 size=0xDAD0`), so nothing precedes the map.

**The operating system pointer.** SDL has one cursor for the whole application,
so whoever hides it must show it again: `set_game_cursor_hidden` in
`pump_sdl_events` is the single owner, derives the state from
`SDL_GetMouseFocus() == platform.window && !overlay_visible()` on every pump
(rather than from ENTER/LEAVE, so a window that opens under a stationary pointer
is handled), calls `SDL_ShowCursor` only on a change, and restores the pointer on
the close path. The Esc overlay is its own window (`overlay.cpp:206`,
`SDL_CreateWindow("Ogre Battle 64: Options", ...)`), so the pointer is visible
over it. `OGRE_CURSOR=0` disables this part.

## 4. What was run for verification

The map was reached from the developer's own save without replaying the game:
`OGRE_SAVE=<path>/scene_14.bin OGRE_SAVE_RESET=1`, in an isolated run directory
(`OGRE_PREF_DIR`) so nothing wrote back to the developer's save file. `scene_14`
was chosen by the developer because later chapters have a larger world map.

| Run | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `/tmp/mapcursor-run1.log` | 1169 cursor samples. The first version, before the clamping fixes; 635 distinct positions, x 49..240, y 40..176, 1-2 pixel deltas, `y=40` is the top clamp. This is what ruled out a node grid. |
| `/tmp/mapcursor-run4.log` | 6 clicks. The click count reaching `get_input` is what showed the `A` path fires. |
| `/tmp/mapcursor-run5.log` | 44 edge pushes, 14 clicks. The `[mapcursor] edge push 0x100 at (278,113)` lines are the first proof the edge direction is computed and held. |
| `/tmp/mapcursor-run8.log` | 10 clicks with the game's own cursor beside the pointer, 38 edge pushes. On the loaded map every click has `game=` equal to `at=` (nine at 0-2 pixels; one logged before the map's first real draw as `game=(-1,-1)`). This is the evidence that a click cannot select a location other than the one under the pointer. |
| `/tmp/mapcursor-run9.log` | 14 `[cursor] hidden/shown` transitions, 30 edge pushes, 4 clicks. The pointer hides when it enters the game window and shows again when the overlay opens. |

Developer-confirmed, in their words: the cursor *"moves smoothly"*; a click
*"worked as expected (the character moved to the target location)"*; the edge
scroll *"worked nicely"*; and after the pointer hiding, *"very good!"*.

Builds: `cmake --build build-app --target ogrebattle64` and the same for
`build-null` both link. `tools/map_cursor.py` was run twice (second run reports
`already applied`), then `--revert` and apply again, leaving exactly three
`ogre_map_cursor` references in `BankMFuncs/funcs_0.c`.

**Not verified:** the exit-path pointer restore was not observed in a log,
because `set_game_cursor_hidden` only logs on a change and the pointer was
already visible when run 9's window closed (`[SDL] game window close requested`
is in the log, no `[cursor]` line after it). The `[dialog]`-style visual check of
the pointer hiding was the developer's report, not a capture.

## 5. Files changed

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `app/src/map_cursor.cpp` | new; cursor placement, click confirm, edge scroll, mouse state |
| `app/src/map_cursor.hpp` | new; the state layout and the call site |
| `tools/map_cursor.py` | new; the bank-code patcher |
| `Makefile` | `bank-recomp` re-applies the patcher |
| `app/CMakeLists.txt` | `src/map_cursor.cpp` in both source lists |
| `app/src/sdl_platform.cpp` | mouse sampling, click/edge reporting, pointer visibility; the PR's latched-click block removed |
| `docs/guides/app-build.md` | "The world map's mouse cursor" section and the six knobs |
| `docs/DECISIONS.md` | the 2026-10-10 entry |
| `PLAN.md` | Key technical findings |
| `docs/HANDOFF-2026-10-10-session127.md` | this file |

`BankMFuncs/funcs_0.c` carries the inserted call but is gitignored and
regenerated; the patch is the tracked artifact. Nothing is committed, and
`git status --short` shows only these files plus the modified `tools/RT64`
submodule pointer that predates this session. The merge's `launcher.cpp`,
`main.cpp`, `app/CMakeLists.txt` (COM link) and `elfcheck.py` changes are
untouched.

## 6. Probes used and reverted

- `ogre_cursor_click_apply` and the PR's latched-click block: **deleted**, not
  reverted, because the design was discarded. `git grep cursor_click` is empty.
- The location-record logging (`slot=`, `value=`, `other=`) and the one-shot
  state dump (`OGRE_MAP_CURSOR_DUMP`): **removed** after the developer cancelled
  snap-on-rest. Nothing in the tree reads `state+0x110`/`+0x1CA` any more.
- `OGRE_MAP_CURSOR_EDGE_FORCE` is kept deliberately: it is documented as a
  measurement aid, so a scripted run can hold a direction with nobody at the
  mouse.
- No probe was added to `RecompiledFuncs/`; the only generated-code insertion is
  the production call that `tools/map_cursor.py` owns.

## 7. Open

- The cursor is only wired for scene `0x05`. Scene `0x07` shares the same
  dispatcher pair (`0x8017B858`/`0x8017B9C8`) and the same hook, but it streams a
  different module, and the hook bails out because the state pointer it is given
  is not the map's (`pointer != (uint32_t)state`). No other screen was checked
  for a cursor that would benefit.
- The click's `A` is not edge-triggered against the game's own input: a click
  while a real `A` is held is harmless (OR), but there is no debounce, so a
  double click is two confirms.
- The exit-path pointer restore is implemented and unobserved (see §4).
- The map's scroll speed is whatever the game's held-direction input does; there
  is no acceleration and no measured pixels-per-second.
